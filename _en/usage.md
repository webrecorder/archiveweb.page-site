# How To Create Web Archives with ArchiveWeb.page

With the archiveweb.page Chrome extension, you can archive any pages as you're viewing and interacting with them in your browser.

The first step to archiving is the *capture* process, where the extension will record or capture everything loaded on the page -- HTML, images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, data files and anything else that's part of the page, and store the data in the browser as part of the web archive.

All archived data is organized by pages. You can further organize your archived pages into separate archive collections, view each page to make sure it is archived correctly, and delete invidual page captures that you no longer want or need.

## QUICK INSTRUCTIONS

1. <b>Initiate Session</b>: Click START from the extension icon
2. <b>Capture</b>: Click around the page. Click on assets you want archived. Click on hyperlinks. Click!
3. <b>Terminate Session</b>: Click STOP from the extension icon
<!-- 4. <b>Manage Session</b>: Organize the sessions into collections -->
<!-- 5. <b>Replay Session</b>: Click on View Recorded Page from the extension icon -->
