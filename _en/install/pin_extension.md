### Pin the extension
Pinning an extension just means having the icon accessible in your extensions bar. So you can just click on the extension once rather than having to manage your extensions and finding the webrecorder extension everytime in order to use it.

This is completely optional! Having it pinned won't affect the webrecorder extension, but it should make your experience less tedious.

<b>To pin the extension: </b>
  * Click on the puzzle-like icon (Extensions Icon) that is usually to the right of the address bar.
  * When you click on it, scroll over the list to find the webrecorder extension.
  * Click on the push-pin
  * The webrecorder icon will appear in your extension bar
