#### <b>Managing Your Extensions</b>
You might have noticed that after Chrome confirmed that the extension was installed, the alert goes away and you might not see the webrecorder extension. <br>

There are a couple of ways to access and manage the extension:
* <b>Option 1: Extensions Icon > webrecorder</b>
  * Click on the puzzle-like icon (Extensions Icon) that is usually to the right of the address bar.
  * When you click on it, a list of all of your extensions appears.
* <b>Option 2: More Icon > More Tools > Extensions</b>
  * At the top right of the browser window, click on the three dots (More Options Icon)
  * Look for <b>More Tools</b> on that list
  * Then look for <b>Extensions</b> on that list

<br>

#### <b><a href="pin_extension">Show me how to pin it</a></b>
Pinning an extension just means having the icon accessible in your extensions bar. Just click on the pin icon to have it in your chrome's extensions bar.
