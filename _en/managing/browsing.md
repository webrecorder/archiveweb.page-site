## Browsing Archives in ArchiveWeb.page

Once created, web archive collections remain in the browser and can be accessed at any time from the extension home page.

To browse archives, you can quickly open the extension in several ways:

- From the extension menu, click the HOME button:

  ![home icon view](/assets/images/managing/home-icon-view.png)

<!-- - You can also right click and select *View Web Archives* from the context menu:

  ![menu-view-archives](/assets/images/managing/menu-view-archives.png) -->

- From the ArchiveWeb.page site, clicking on *Browse Web Archives stored in this browser*.


All of these options will take you to the Extension Home Page

## Extension Home Page / All Archives View

The ArchiveWeb.page extension home page lists all of the available web archive collections.

You can click on each individual archive to load the archive collection view.
