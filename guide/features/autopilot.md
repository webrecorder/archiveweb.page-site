# Using Autopilot
You might have noticed that scrolling infinitely is a chore. 
<br>
<br>
To make some parts a less manual process, we've included autopilot to help you scroll and automate certain behaviors on certain sites such as Twitter and Instagram!
With the last update (0.6.1), you should see a new feature: <b>Start with Autopilot</b>
<br>
<br>

## Before capture: Start Autopilot with checkbox
You can check off this box before you start capture on pages like Twitter or Instagram and watch it go. Be sure to let the page load before clicking on anything. 
<br><br>

Note: This <i>can</i> work on other sites, but if the page is "short" or doesn't have scroll infinitely, to won't work as well as one would hope.

## During capture: Start Autopilot with button
Did you start a capture and realized you actually want to use the Autopilot feature? You can still run the autopilot feature by clicking on the <b>Start Autopilot</b> button.
