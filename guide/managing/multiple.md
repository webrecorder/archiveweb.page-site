ArchiveWeb.page supports organizing your archived pages into distinct web archival collections, which can be viewed, searched, and downloaded separately.

While the smallest unit in ArchiveWeb.page is a page, the archival collection, or simply 'web archive', provides another unit of organization to pages.

(Note: At this time, its not yet possible to move pages between collections, but this is something that may be added in the future).

## Creating a New Archive

New archives can be created either from the extension home page or from the extension popup menu.

### From the home page

Enter the name of the web archive and click *Create New* to create. The new archive will be added to the list below.

### From the extension popup

A new archive can also be created from the extension menu, before capture/recording is started:

1. Click on the drop down under *Record To* and select *Create New Archive*

2. Enter the name of the new archive and click the check button.

3. This web archive will now be the default for future recording/capturing sessions.

### Choosing the Web Archive

As shown above, the web archive can be selected before recording/capture is started. The selection is then remembered for next time.

You can use this to choose a new default web archive, or create a new one, before starting capture. (The web archive can not be changed once capturing has started).
